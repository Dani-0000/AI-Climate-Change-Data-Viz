For this assignment, we looked into investments in artificial intelligence made by private companies and compared them to the higher carbon emissions and rising temperatures. We hypothesize that energy consumption rises as global investment in AI increases, resulting in higher carbon emissions and rising temperatures. This disproportionally affects developing countries, which often lack the resources to address or mitigate the environmental consequences. As AI advancements continue to grow exponentially, countries will need to significantly intensify their efforts to address the negative climate impacts to preserve and protect our environment for the future. We first explored the development of AI across different countries, identifying which countries invest the most in AI and how these investments have evolved. Next, we explored the carbon footprint of these countries and their implications by investigating the rise in their temperatures. Lastly, we compared these findings with those of developing countries that are most vulnerable to climate change.
